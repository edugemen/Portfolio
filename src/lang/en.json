    "projects.1.title": "Web application for a volleyball team.",
    "projects.1.description.1": "I made this website for my volleyball team and it shows the ranking of the league we play in, as well as the matches we have played and the ones we have left.",
    "projects.1.description.2": "It is made with Astro and React with TypeScript. It also has a server made with Node.js that takes care of downloading the new images that are uploaded to the team's Instagram and reduces them so they don't take up too much space. Finally, the live scoreboard of the streaming we do on Twitch is connected to the website.",
    "projects.2.title": "Desktop application to receive a sensor reading and perform some operations.",
    "projects.2.description.1": "A friend and I did this project as freelancers to take readings from a sensor and do some real time minimum calculations. It was the first time I worked using Rust, but I really liked the Tauri environment and decided to use it. It was a challenge to get the application to run smoothly with thousands of points on graphs. I made the desktop application, which connected via wifi to an ESP32 microcontroller, which is what my partner programmed.",
    "projects.3.title": "Mobile application to control a volleyball scoreboard.",
    "projects.3.description.1": "Also for the volleyball team, two friends of the team and I decided to develop a physical scoreboard along with one that would be seen in the streams we do on Twitch. I made the mobile app to control the scoreboard and a small server made in Node.js to which the online scoreboard for the streaming and the physical scoreboard are connected. It was a very interesting project and it turned out quite well.",
